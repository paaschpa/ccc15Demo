Files and notes from Chicago Code Camp 2015 talk

CanaryMod-1.7.10-1.1.3.jar 
- This is the minecraft server
- start it using java -jar -Xmx1024 CanaryMod-1.7.10-1.1.3.jar -o
- running the first time will create a new folders/files
- find eula.txt and change false to true. Start server again

scriptcraft.jar
- this is the plugin for CanaryMod server.
- after starting the server, place it in the plugins directory
- restart the server using command above

If everything is working you should be able to enter 1+1 in the Server console and see "2".

Start your Minecraft game
- The files in this repo are for version 1.7.10
- To change your profile select 'Edit Profile' on the 'News Page' of the game (before you hit 'Play') and select 1.7.10 and 'Save Profile'
- Hit 'Play' and choose 'Multiplayer'
- In the 'Multiplayer' window choose 'Direct Connect'
- If you are playing on the same machine running the server enter 'localhost'
- See below if you are playing the game not from the machine running the server
- To use the /js command you must be an 'OP'. On the server console type op <your playername> or add your player name in the /config/ops.cfg

Have another player join (not covered in talk because of network issues)
- Get the ip address of the machine running the CanaryMod server
- Make sure profile is '1.7.10'
- Choose 'Multiplayer' and 'Direct Connect'
- enter the <server ip address>:25565 (ie. 192.168.1.78:25565)
- 25565 is the default port for CanaryMod and can be changed in the /config/server.cfg file
- On the server console or from an already OP'd player op <new players name> 

Try some commands
time set 17000 
/js blocktype("Hello World",blocks.glowstone)
/js self.getCapabilities().mayFly()
/js self.getCapabilities().setMayFly(true)
/js self.updateCapabilities()

/js box0(1,4,1,10) //0
/js for(var i=0;i<10;i++){echo(1);}
/js for(var(i=0;i<20;i++){up(i).box(i,1);}
/js for(var(i=0;i<20;i++){right(i).box(1,1,10);}

Example of using the Java library from the game.
This should pop a window on machine running the server
/js load('nashorn:mozilla_compat.js')
/js importPackage(java.awt);
/js var pane = new java.awt.Frame('hi');
/js pane.setVisible(true);
